In Java, there are several types of sorting algorithms that can be implemented or used from built-in libraries. These algorithms can be categorized based on their approach, efficiency, and use cases. Below is a list of common sorting algorithms and their types:

---

### **1. Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms**
These algorithms compare elements to determine their order.

#### **a. Bubble Sort**
- **How it works**: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in the worst and average cases.
- **Use Case**: Simple to implement but inefficient for large datasets.

#### **b. Selection Sort**
- **How it works**: Selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in all cases.
- **Use Case**: Inefficient for large datasets but uses minimal memory.

#### **c. Insertion Sort**
- **How it works**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (if the array is already sorted).
- **Use Case**: Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.

#### **d. Merge Sort**
- **How it works**: Divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all cases.
- **Use Case**: Efficient for large datasets and stable (preserves the order of equal elements).

#### **e. Quick Sort**
- **How it works**: Picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) on average, O(n²) in the worst case (if the pivot is poorly chosen).
- **Use Case**: Efficient for large datasets and widely used in practice.

#### **f. Heap Sort**
- **How it works**: Builds a heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in all cases.
- **Use Case**: Efficient for large datasets but not stable.

### **2. Non-Comparison-Based Sorting Algorithms**
These algorithms do not compare elements directly but use other properties to sort.

#### **a. Counting Sort**
- **How it works**: Counts the occurrences of each element and uses this information to place elements in the correct position.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k), where `k` is the range of input.
- **Use Case**: Efficient for sorting integers within a small range.

#### **b. Radix Sort**
- **How it works**: Sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from the least significant digit.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), where `k` is the number of digits.
- **Use Case**: Efficient for sorting integers or strings with fixed-length keys.

#### **c. Bucket Sort**
- **How it works**: Distributes elements into buckets, sorts each bucket, and concatenates the results.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k) on average, where `k` is the number of buckets.
- **Use Case**: Efficient for uniformly distributed data.

### **3. Hybrid Sorting Algorithms**
These algorithms combine two or more sorting techniques to improve performance.

#### **a. Tim Sort**
- **How it works**: Combines Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. It divides the array into small chunks, sorts them using Insertion Sort, and then merges them using Merge Sort.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case.
- **Use Case**: Used in Java's `Arrays.sort()` for objects and Python's built-in sort.

### **4. Built-In Sorting in Java**
Java provides built-in methods for sorting arrays and collections:
- **`Arrays.sort()`**: Sorts arrays of primitives and objects.
    - For primitives, it uses **Dual-Pivot Quick Sort**.
    - For objects, it uses **Tim Sort**.
- **`Collections.sort()`**: Sorts lists of objects using **Tim Sort**.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class SortingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sorting an array
        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 9, 1, 6};
        Arrays.sort(numbers);
        System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));

        // Sorting a list
        List<Integer> numberList = Arrays.asList(5, 3, 9, 1, 6);
        Collections.sort(numberList);
        System.out.println("Sorted list: " + numberList);
    }
}
```

### **When to Use Which Algorithm?**
- Use **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, or **Insertion Sort** for small datasets or educational purposes.
- Use **Merge Sort** or **Quick Sort** for large datasets.
- Use **Counting Sort**, **Radix Sort**, or **Bucket Sort** for specific data types (e.g., integers or strings).
- Use Java's built-in **`Arrays.sort()`** or **`Collections.sort()`** for general-purpose sorting.

By understanding these sorting algorithms, you can choose the most efficient one for your specific use case in Java.
